# Deep Learning (PyTorch)

This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Deep Learning v7 Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various deep learning topics. In most cases, the notebooks lead you through implementing models such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and GANs. There are other topics covered such as weight initialization and batch normalization.

There are also notebooks used as projects for the Nanodegree program.

### Tutorials

### Introduction to Neural Networks

* [Introduction to Neural Networks](https://github.com/sndpkirwai/udacity-deeplearning-specializationion/tree/main/intro-neural-networks): Learn how to implement gradient descent and apply it to predicting patterns in student admissions data.
* [Sentiment Analysis with NumPy](https://github.com/sndpkirwai/udacity-deeplearning-specializationion/tree/main/sentiment-analysis-network): leads you through building a sentiment analysis model, predicting if some text is positive or negative.
* [Bike sharing Neural networks Project](https://github.com/sndpkirwai/udacity-deeplearning-specializationion/tree/main/project-bikesharing): This is an assignment wherein a multiple linear regression model is built to predict demand for shared bikes depending on the current trend.
* [Introduction to PyTorch]: Learn how to build neural networks in PyTorch and use pre-trained networks for state-of-the-art image classifiers.
