# Deep Learning (PyTorch)

This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Deep Learning v7 Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various deep learning topics. In most cases, the notebooks lead you through implementing models such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and GANs. There are other topics covered such as weight initialization and batch normalization.

There are also notebooks used as projects for the Nanodegree program.

### Introduction to Neural Networks

* [Introduction to Neural Networks](https://github.com/sndpkirwai/udacity-deeplearning-specializationion/tree/main/intro-neural-networks): Learn how to implement gradient descent and apply it to predicting patterns in student admissions data.
* [Sentiment Analysis with NumPy](https://github.com/sndpkirwai/udacity-deeplearning-specializationion/tree/main/sentiment-analysis-network): leads you through building a sentiment analysis model, predicting if some text is positive or negative.
* [Bike sharing Neural networks Project](https://github.com/sndpkirwai/udacity-deeplearning-specializationion/tree/main/project-bikesharing): This is an assignment wherein a multiple linear regression model is built to predict demand for shared bikes depending on the current trend.
* [Introduction to PyTorch](https://github.com/sndpkirwai/udacity-deeplearning-specializationion/tree/main/intro-to-pytorch): Learn how to build neural networks in PyTorch and use pre-trained networks for state-of-the-art image classifiers.
* [Convolutional Neural networks](https://github.com/sndpkirwai/udacity-deeplearning-specializationion/tree/main/CNN): Here we will see how implement simple conv layer with single and multiple hidden layer with FC layer to predict the classifiers. Also learn complex CNN model like AlexNet , VGG16 etc.
* [AutoEncoder for NN & CNN](https://github.com/sndpkirwai/udacity-deeplearning-specializationion/tree/main/autoencoder): This will show how to use encoder and decoder techniques for NN & CNN to reduce the noise from input and get non-noisy output from decoder.
* [Weight initialization for linerar layer of NN](https://github.com/sndpkirwai/udacity-deeplearning-specializationion/tree/main/weight-initialization): Here we will how to set initial weights to linear layer with 0, normarl distribution and compare the model accuracy to check best weight fit.
* [Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM RNN model](https://github.com/sndpkirwai/udacity-deeplearning-specializationion/tree/main/sentiment-rnn) : Here we will try to find out if sentence is positive or negative sentiment. 
* [Batch Normalization implementation] (https://github.com/sndpkirwai/udacity-deeplearning-specializationion/tree/main/batch_normalization)
