# Deep Learning with PyTorch

This repo contains notebooks and related code for Udacity's Deep Learning with PyTorch lesson. This lesson appears in our [AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089).

* **Part 1:** Introduction to PyTorch and using tensors
* **Part 2:** Neural network PyTorch structure and hidden layer with ReLU activation function
* **Part 3:** Training NN: Training model consists of:
1. trainset (MNIST dataset)
2.Define sequential model with input layer, 1 hidden layer and output layer.
3. hidden layer and output layer input has ReLU activation function. and output has LogSoftmax activation function.
4. Define loss with NLLLOSS
5.Define optimerzer with stochastic gradient descent optimizer
6. Define zero gradient for training to clear the gradients, do this because gradients are accumulated
8. Train the model
9. In forward pass, calculate the loss
10. Backprapogation
11.With optimizer update weight
12. Check the prediction with test dataset
* **Part 4:** Training NN with Fashion MNIST dataset
* **Part 4:** Training NN with Fashion MNIST dataset with validation set and dropout to overcome overfitting model
